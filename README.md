## Contributing is *very* **EASY**!
If you want to add a colorfile for a program, that is not existing yet, just contribute the conf.*programname* file and change the **grcpp.conf** file accordingly. These pull requests will most likely be merged, even if that program is not very popular.

If you want to change an already existing file, that change should serve any purpose (maybe it makes the regexes more precise or adds functionality). If your pull request only changes colors based off some personal preference, that pull request will most likely not be merged.
